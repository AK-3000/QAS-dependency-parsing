Automatic question answering System(QAS) is a highly researched topic in the field of Natural Language Processing and Information retrieval. A QAS is used to retrieve the correct answer for a given question from a paragraph.This project experiments into a rule-based approach for what-questions using dependency parsing. With the help of extensive dependency relations, we retrieve the exact answers for the factoid questions. The inspiration behind this methodology is to replicate human thought process when answering reading comprehension questions. Furthermore, extensive analysis was also done to understand the challenges faced by dependency parsing method for answer identification. The dataset is complied from the The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0).
